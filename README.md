# pandora
Pandora is domain agnostic framework for case study generation and solving.

## Strategy
I've divided the task into two parts. Divide the task into two factions - Module 1 is Generator, Module 2 is Solver. The task of generator is to come up with elaborate, well thought of case studies which covers a wide variety of domains/ or could be domain agnostic. Module 2 on the other hand is Solver, whose task is to solve these case sstudies, using different frameworks. Frameworks are like adapters which are basically dspy equivalent of mental model solvers.

Before these however, we need some high quality few shot examples which need to be there for both of the modules teleprompters. I will work partly in both domains, and will try to do more during this weekend. Will update. 

## Checklist
The task at hand is more knowledge intensive, so developing multi-hop + retreival + LMs should be there.
