## Solver? I hardly know 'er

Solvers, are a part of module 2 of pandora whose task is to analyze and solve the case studies using some predefined framework. Doing so lets us understand how the model performs on those benchmarks, and then we can run some tests to analyze them.
As of now, I'm working with 3 modules, namely **Chain of Though**, **ReAct**, and a combination of those two. More on the type of experiments and the results will be updated here.
